# TEACH2GIVE-Group7
This is a simple repo. The repo showcases a group project for CRUD operations. The simple web based solution should allow users to create posts, view them and delete them. The project should have an admin who can perform all the CRUD operations and other users whose operations are limited. Users can view other users posts but cannot delete them.
